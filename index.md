    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>I am currently a PhD candidate working with Matthew Osmond in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Toronto. I am broadly interested in questions at the intersection of stochastic processes and evolutionary biology. See my research page for more details. I previously worked with Hildegard Uecker at the MPI for Evolutionary Biology and Neeraja Sahasrabuddhe at IISER Mohali for my Master's thesis and did my BS-MS at the Indian Institute for Science Education and Research (Mohali).  </p>
